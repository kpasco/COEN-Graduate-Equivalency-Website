Things you will need to to get this running:

1. Make sure you have python installed

2. in the terminal get into this directory and then type out virtualenv env

3. Then write into the terminal - "pip install django" - this will install django

4. Next, write the following command - "pip install mysql-python" - this will install the ORM that lets us talk to mysql

So those commands will set up all the python. What is required after that is to set up the mysql database:

If you haven't already, e-mail Lantz at that email we found on the mysql site. He'll hook it up with your own mysql ECC username and database.

Once you have those, you'll be able to use the mysql database stuff. I think all that you'll need to do there is change the values within settings.py.
